"Controlling for Confounding in Machine Learning Genetic Predictions, A Comparison"

Comparison of two methods of confounder adjustment in machine learning genetic predictions - namely input (traditional, widely implemented) and output (recently introduced) methods. 

XGBoost gradient boosting was utilised in both methods on UK BioBank Fluid Intelligence Phenotype data. The methods were compared in terms of model performance, accuracy, time elapsed and computational burden.

The following files include examples of code and data utilised, along with some results computed after the two methods were successfully implemented. These findings further confirm the work of Dinga et al. who first challenged the use of input adjustment and proposed this method of output adjustment.
